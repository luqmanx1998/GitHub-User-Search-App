## Overview

A small but interactive and functional app, using Github's API to search out users! 

## Challenges Faced

- **3rd Party API**  

  This project was another milestone for me, as this was my first time in practice actually using a 3rd party API, Github's api in this case. It was a fun project where I got to expand my horizons and actually build something fully interactive and functional, with a real world application! 

## Key Features

Search functionality: Using GitHub's API to search out github users and display basic information, such as username, join date and more!

Light & Dark Mode: The Light/Dark mode toggle switches between a light and dark theme for the app!

Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

## Tools & Techniques

- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **JavaScript**: DOM Manipulation, API, Event Delegation, DOM Traversing & Dynamic State Management
- **Responsive Design**: Leveraging `display`, `position`, and other CSS properties to create a fluid layout beyond simple media queries.
- **Problem-Solving**: Using past project experience to tackle unexpected layout issues.
